# Problems for Developers

1. The Magical Sorting Hat:
   Imagine you are creating a magical sorting hat for a wizard school. Implement a Javascript function that takes an array of student names and assign them to one of the four houses (Gryffindor (length less than 6) Hufflepuff (length less than 8) Ravenclaw (length less than 12) or Slytherin (length greater than 12)) based on the length of their names.

2. The Double Trouble:
   You are tasked with writing a function that doubles  each element in an array. However, there's a catch: if the array contains consicutive duplicate elements, only double one of them.

3. The Mirror Mirror:
   Imagine you have string, and you need to create a new string that is a mirror image of teh original. Write a function that appends the reversed version of the original string to itself.

4. The Password Validator:
   You are building a password validation feature. Create a function that checks if a given password meets the following criteria: at least 8 characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, and includes atleast one digit.

5. The Sum Selector:
   You are working on a function that should sum all numbers in an array until it encounters a negative number. Write a function that performs this summation.

6. The Vowel Counter:
   You need to create a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string. Consider both uppercase andlowercase vowels.

7. The Local Storage Manager:
   You are working on a note-taking app, and you want to implement a function named saveNoteToLocalStorage that takes a note object and saves it to the browser's local storage.

8. Async Array Mapping:
   Write an asynchronous function that takes an array of numbers and return a new array of Promisses where each number is multiplied by 2 after a delay of 500 milliseconds.

9. The Asynchronous Shopper:
   Imagine you are building an online shopping application. Write an asynchronous function called placeOrder that simulates placing order and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with an oreder confrimation message after a random delay.

10. The Coffee Machine:
    In your coffee shop application, you need to simulate the process of brewing coffee asynchronously. Write an async function named brewCoffee that takes the type of coffee and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with a message indicating that the coffee is ready after a random delay.
